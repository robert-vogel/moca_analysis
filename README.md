# Moca data analysis


In this repository, we share our data analysis
scripts for making plots shown in the figure panels
of our manuscript.  The plots were generated using
the Python programming language v3.11.2, the
packages located in `requirements.txt` file, and
combined into figure panels using keynote.

In each directory there is a shell script,
data, and Python tools. The README.md
files in each figure directory explains
how to reproduce the analysis.
