# Moca data analysis


In this repository, we share our scripts for 
making plots shown in figure panels of our
manuscript.  The plots were generated using
the Python programming language v3.11.2, the
packages located in `requirements.txt` file, and
combined into figure panels using keynote.

In each directory there is a shell script,
data, and Python tools.  The general approach is
that the plots can be reproduced by running the 
respective shell script.
See the README in the figure directories for 
specifics relevant to that figure panel.
